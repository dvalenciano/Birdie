**_Description_**

This project is to show the understanding of fullstack web development from start to finish.

The idea behind this project is to create a full stack application that will store bird sightings that amateur bird watchers can create for later recollection and monitoring of the health of the bird ecosystem in their backyard. As a bird watcher there is a good amount of birds that call the backyard home. This application is aimed at tracking those details for bird watchers to access with ease and confidence of the data.

**_Getting Started_**

You can access the App by following this [link!](). Here you will find the early stages of this working application.
